The Commerce Operations Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit 501(c)(6) industry body dedicated to creating open standards for how modern commerce systems interoperate. As AI, social commerce, and new selling channels transform how orders originate, the industry requires a shared operational language that ensures fulfillment, inventory, and order data can move reliably across every part of the ecosystem.

The Foundation stewards the Order Network eXchange (onX), the first open standard that defines how orders, inventory, products, shipments, and returns flow between selling channels, back office systems, and fulfillment networks. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), onX provides the common foundation needed for real-time, AI-ready commerce operations.

Guided by four core principles — Open, Neutral, Interoperable, and Extensible — the Foundation maintains the onX specification, oversees its governance, and brings together the organizations shaping the next generation of commerce infrastructure. Through working groups, a technical steering committee, and publicly available reference implementations, the Foundation enables companies to adopt and influence interoperable standards with confidence.

The Commerce Operations Foundation represents a growing global community of retailers, brands, platforms, 3PLs, logistics providers, and technology vendors who share a vision for a more connected, intelligent, and resilient commerce ecosystem. Membership is open to organizations and practitioners committed to advancing open standards that future-proof the industry.
